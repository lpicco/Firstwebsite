        <h2>The beggining</h2>
        <p>Gangsta rap and gun violence have a complicated relationship of causality, and all too often the symbiotic connection between the two gets mistaken for parasitism by parties who see the music imposing a criminal mindset on impressionable youth. The war on drugs and the resultant gun violence in the inner city kicked up the sparks that ignited gangsta rap, and the first wave of superstars of the genre were very vocal about their role as documentarians<p>
<h2>Gang Violence in Toronto</h2>
<p>Toronto based rappers and gangs are becoming more and more violent most recently gunned down was rapper Houdini who was involved in the scene,Hip hop artist Houdini was a star on the rise but, sadly, was unable to escape the gun violence that has now claimed five Toronto-area rappers in five months.Houdini was killed in a shooting that also wounded a boy, 15, and an innocent woman, 27, in the Entertainment District Tuesday afternoon.</p>   </body>
